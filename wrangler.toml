# This is the binding that allows sending emails
# You must configure this in the Cloudflare Dashboard as well or bind it here if using newer wrangler features
# But typically for Send Email binding, it's done via Dashboard > Settings > Bindings
# or locally via `wrangler dev --email` (experimental/limited support)

# For deployment, ensure the 'EMAIL' binding is set up in the dashboard
# pointing to Cloudflare Email Routing.
